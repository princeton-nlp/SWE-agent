The SWE-agent repository is built to make it easy to invent new ACIs for agents to solve various tasks.</p> <p>Just like how typical language models requires good prompt engineering, good ACI design leads to much better results when using agents.

The file editor that we built has commands for scrolling up and down and for performing a search within the file.</li> <li>We supply the agent with a special-built full-directory string searching command.

Jump ahead to the installation or usage sections.</p> <p></p> <p>The central entry point to SWE-agent is the <code>run.py</code> script (1). It initializes the <code>SWEEnv</code> instance (2) that manages the environment. Upon initialization (and by default for every new instance), it starts a docker container together with a shell session (3). This shell session will be kept alive throughout the task. All installation commands and actions from the model will be executed therein.</p> <p><code>SWEEnv</code> then installs the dependencies of the repository to which the task instance belongs into a new conda environment (4).</p> <p>The second class that is initialized by <code>run.py</code> is the <code>Agent</code> class (5). It can be configured with a yaml file (see config). It's most important method is <code>forward()</code> which prompts the model and executes its action.</p> <p>To prompt the model, the history (all prompts to the model together with actions and outputs) need to be sent to the LM. In order to make the best use of the context window of the model, the history gets compressed by a <code>HistoryProcessor</code> (7).

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n      If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\n      Note that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n    instance_template: |-\n      We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\n      ISSUE:\n      {{problem_statement}}\n\n      INSTRUCTIONS:\n      Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n      Remember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\n      When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n      Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\n\n      NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n      IMPORTANT TIPS:\n      1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n        If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n        Then start trying to fix it.\n        When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n        If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n        so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n      2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n      3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n      4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n      5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n      6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n      7. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code.

Run <code>sweagent --help</code> to see all options. Splitting up both commands made it easier to make both use cases more convenient and flexible.</li> <li>We have switched to a hierarchical configuration system.

To learn about the agent class itself, see the agent class reference page.</p> <p>It might be easiest to simply look at some of our example configurations in the config dir.</p> Example: default config <code>default.yaml</code> <pre><code>agent:\n  templates:\n    system_template: |-\n      SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\n      The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {{WINDOW}} lines of a file at a time.\n      In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n      To call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\n      Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\n      For example, if you are looking at this file:\n\n      def fct():\n          print(\"Hello world\")\n\n      and you want to edit the file to read:\n\n      def fct():\n          print(\"Hello\")\n          print(\"world\")\n\n      you search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n      (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\n      You could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\n      RESPONSE FORMAT:\n      Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n      (Open file: &lt;path&gt;)\n      (Current directory: &lt;cwd&gt;)\n      bash-$\n\n      First, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\n      Then, for every response, you must include exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\n      Remember, you should always include a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n      If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\n      Note that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n    instance_template: |-\n      We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\n      ISSUE:\n      {{problem_statement}}\n\n      INSTRUCTIONS:\n      Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n      Remember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\n      When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n      Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\n\n      NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n      IMPORTANT TIPS:\n      1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n        If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n        Then start trying to fix it.\n        When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n        If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n        so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n      2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n      3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n      4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n      5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n      6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n      7. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code. Please think about how to install the environment from the repository directory if you need to do so.\n\n      (Open file: {{open_file}})\n      (Current directory: {{working_dir}})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_template: |-\n      {{observation}}\n      (Open file: {{open_file}})\n      (Current directory: {{working_dir}})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_no_output_template: |-\n      Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\n      (Open file: {{open_file}})\n      (Current directory: {{working_dir}})\n      bash-$\n    demonstration_template: |\n      Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\n      It is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\n      You do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n      --- DEMONSTRATION ---\n      {{demonstration}}\n      --- END OF DEMONSTRATION ---\n    demonstrations:\n    - trajectories/demonstrations/replay__marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867__function_calling_replace_from_source/marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867.traj\n    put_demos_in_history: true\n  tools:\n    env_variables:\n      WINDOW: 100\n      OVERLAP: 2\n    bundles:\n      - path: tools/registry\n      - path: tools/defaults\n      - path: tools/search\n      - path: tools/edit_replace\n      - path: tools/submit\n    enable_bash_tool: true\n    parse_function:\n      type: function_calling\n  history_processors:\n    - type: last_n_observations\n      n: 5\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig","title":"sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig  <code>pydantic-model</code>","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>BaseModel</code></p> <p>This configuration object specifies the behavior of an agent.</p> <p>Config:</p> <ul> <li><code>extra</code>: <code>'forbid'</code></li> </ul> <p>Fields:</p> <ul> <li> <code>name</code>                 (<code>str</code>)             </li> <li> <code>templates</code>                 (<code>TemplateConfig</code>)             </li> <li> <code>tools</code>                 (<code>ToolConfig</code>)             </li> <li> <code>history_processors</code>                 (<code>list[HistoryProcessor]</code>)             </li> <li> <code>model</code>                 (<code>ModelConfig</code>)             </li> <li> <code>max_requeries</code>                 (<code>int</code>)             </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig.history_processors","title":"history_processors  <code>pydantic-field</code>","text":"<pre><code>history_processors: list[HistoryProcessor]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig.max_requeries","title":"max_requeries  <code>pydantic-field</code>","text":"<pre><code>max_requeries: int = 3\n</code></pre> <p>Maximum number of times to requery the model after an error, such as a formatting error, a blocked action, or a bash syntax error.</p>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig.model","title":"model  <code>pydantic-field</code>","text":"<pre><code>model: ModelConfig\n</code></pre> <p>Model options.</p>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig.name","title":"name  <code>pydantic-field</code>","text":"<pre><code>name: str = 'main'\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig.templates","title":"templates  <code>pydantic-field</code>","text":"<pre><code>templates: TemplateConfig\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/agent_config/#sweagent.agent.agents.AgentConfig.tools","title":"tools  <code>pydantic-field</code>","text":"<pre><code>tools: ToolConfig\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/batch_instances/","title":"Batch instances","text":""},{"location":"reference/batch_instances/#sweagent.run.batch_instances.logger","title":"logger  <code>module-attribute</code>","text":"<pre><code>logger = get_logger('swea-config', emoji='\ud83d\udd27')\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/batch_instances/#sweagent.run.batch_instances.BatchInstanceSourceConfig","title":"BatchInstanceSourceConfig  <code>module-attribute</code>","text":"<pre><code>BatchInstanceSourceConfig = InstancesFromHuggingFace | InstancesFromFile | SWEBenchInstances | ExpertInstancesFromFile\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/batch_instances/#sweagent.run.batch_instances.AbstractInstanceSource","title":"AbstractInstanceSource","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>ABC</code></p> <p>Anything that adheres to this standard can be used to load instances.</p>"},{"location":"reference/batch_instances/#sweagent.run.batch_instances.AbstractInstanceSource.get_instance_configs","title":"get_instance_configs  <code>abstractmethod</code>","text":"<pre><code>get_instance_configs() -&gt;

Let's take a look at it:</p> Example: default config <code>default.yaml</code> <pre><code>agent:\n  templates:\n    system_template: |-\n      SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\n      The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {{WINDOW}} lines of a file at a time.\n      In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n      To call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\n      Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\n      For example, if you are looking at this file:\n\n      def fct():\n          print(\"Hello world\")\n\n      and you want to edit the file to read:\n\n      def fct():\n          print(\"Hello\")\n          print(\"world\")\n\n      you search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n      (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\n      You could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\n      RESPONSE FORMAT:\n      Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n      (Open file: &lt;path&gt;)\n      (Current directory: &lt;cwd&gt;)\n      bash-$\n\n      First, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\n      Then, for every response, you must include exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\n      Remember, you should always include a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n      If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\n      Note that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n    instance_template: |-\n      We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\n      ISSUE:\n      {{problem_statement}}\n\n      INSTRUCTIONS:\n      Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n      Remember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\n      When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n      Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\n\n      NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n      IMPORTANT TIPS:\n      1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n        If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n        Then start trying to fix it.\n        When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n        If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n        so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n      2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n      3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n      4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n      5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n      6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n      7. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code. Please think about how to install the environment from the repository directory if you need to do so.\n\n      (Open file: {{open_file}})\n      (Current directory: {{working_dir}})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_template: |-\n      {{observation}}\n      (Open file: {{open_file}})\n      (Current directory: {{working_dir}})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_no_output_template: |-\n      Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\n      (Open file: {{open_file}})\n      (Current directory: {{working_dir}})\n      bash-$\n    demonstration_template: |\n      Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\n      It is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\n      You do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n      --- DEMONSTRATION ---\n      {{demonstration}}\n      --- END OF DEMONSTRATION ---\n    demonstrations:\n    - trajectories/demonstrations/replay__marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867__function_calling_replace_from_source/marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867.traj\n    put_demos_in_history: true\n  tools:\n    env_variables:\n      WINDOW: 100\n      OVERLAP: 2\n    bundles:\n      - path: tools/registry\n      - path: tools/defaults\n      - path: tools/search\n      - path: tools/edit_replace\n      - path: tools/submit\n    enable_bash_tool: true\n    parse_function:\n      type: function_calling\n  history_processors:\n    - type: last_n_observations\n      n: 5\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, this is where all the templates are defined!</p> <p>This file is also loaded when no other <code>--config</code> options are specified.

It's simple: Each of these types has a different set of required options (e.g., <code>github_url</code> is required for <code>GithubIssue</code>, but not for <code>TextProblemStatement</code>). SWE-agent will automatically select the correct configuration object based on the command line options you provide.</p> <p>However, you can also explicitly specify the type of problem statement you want to use by adding a <code>--problem_statement.type</code> option.</p> <p>Union type errors</p> <p>If you ever ran a SWE-agent command and got a very long error message about various configuration options not working, it is because for union types. If everything works correctly, we try to initialize every option until we find the one that works based on your inputs (for example stopping at <code>TextProblemStatement</code> if you provided a <code>--problem_statement.text</code>). However, if none of them work, we throw an error which then tells you why we cannot initialize any of the types (so it will tell you that <code>github_url</code> is required for <code>GithubIssue</code>, even though you might not even have tried to work on a GitHub issue).</p> <p>Example union type errors   Example union type errors <p>This is the output of running</p> <pre><code>sweagent run --problem_statement.path=\"test\" --problem_statement.github_url=\"asdf\"\n</code></pre> <p><pre><code>\u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502 Validation error                                                                                                  \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                                   \u2502\n\u2502 The following errors are raised by Pydantic, trying to instantiate the configuration based on                     \u2502\n\u2502 the merged configuration dictionary (see above).                                                                  \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                                   \u2502\n\u2502 Every new indented block corresponds to a different error from Pydantic.                                          \u2502\n\u2502 The first line of each block is the attribute that failed validation, the following lines are the error messages. \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                                   \u2502\n\u2502 If you see many lines of errors, there are probably different ways to instantiate the same object (a union type). \u2502\n\u2502 For example, there are different deployments with different options each.

For this, put the problem you want to solve in a markdown file <code>problem.md</code>, for example:</p> Example leetcode challenge  This is the first missing positive challenge.  <pre><code>Given an unsorted integer array nums.\nReturn the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.\n\nYou must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.\n\n## Example 1:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [1,2,0]\n&gt; Output: 3\n&gt; Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.\n\n## Example 2:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]\n&gt; Output: 2\n&gt; Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.\n\n## Example 3:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]\n&gt; Output: 1\n&gt; Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.\n\n## Constraints:\n\n1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105\n-231 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 231 - 1\n</code></pre> <p>Second, we need to specify a repository wherein SWE-agent will work.

However, it might take an additional step, so it's best to directly specify them.</p> <p>Make sure to commit all changes to the repository:</p> <pre><code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"Add problem stub\"\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we can let SWE-agent solve the problem:</p> <pre><code>sweagent run \\\n    --config config/coding_challenge.yaml \\\n    --problem_statement.path=problem.md \\\n    --env.repo.path=/path/to/empty \\\n    --agent.model.name=gpt4 \\\n    --agent.model.per_instance_cost_limit 3.0 \\\n    --actions.apply_patch_locally=True\n</code></pre> Output <pre><code>2024-07-12 17:57:39,876 INFO \ud83d\udcd9 Arguments: actions:\n  apply_patch_locally: false\n  open_pr: false\n  push_gh_repo_url: ''\n  skip_if_commits_reference_issue: true\nagent:\n  config:\n    _commands:\n    - arguments:\n        line_number:\n          description: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the\n            window will start at the top of the file)\n          required: false\n          type: integer\n        path:\n          description: the path to the file to open\n          required: true\n          type: string\n      code: 'open() {    if [ -z \"$1\" ]    then        echo \"Usage: open &lt;file&gt;\"        return    fi    #\n        Check if the second argument is provided    if [ -n \"$2\" ]; then        #\n        Check if the provided argument is a valid number        if !

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n      Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n      When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n      Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python &lt;script_name&gt;.py`.\n\n      NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n      IMPORTANT TIPS:\n      1. Write your solution in main.py. Always test your code thoroughly before submitting, and if any of the tests fail, try to fix the code before continuing.\n\n      2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n      3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n      4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n      5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n      (Open file: {open_file})\n      (Current directory: {working_dir})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_no_output_template: |-\n      Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\n      (Open file: {open_file})\n      (Current directory: {working_dir})\n      bash-$\n    next_step_template: |-\n      {observation}\n      (Open file: {open_file})\n      (Current directory: {working_dir})\n      bash-$\n    parse_command: {}\n    parse_function: {}\n    put_demos_in_history: false\n    state_command:\n      arguments: null\n      code: |\n        state() {\n          local working_dir=\"$PWD\";\n          if [ -z $CURRENT_FILE ]; then\n              echo '{\"open_file\": \"n/a\", \"working_dir\": \"'$working_dir'\"}';\n          else\n              echo '{\"open_file\": \"'$(realpath $CURRENT_FILE)'\", \"working_dir\": \"'$working_dir'\"}';\n          fi\n        };\n      docstring: null\n      end_name: null\n      name: state\n      signature: null\n    strategy_template: null\n    submit_command: submit\n    subroutine_types: []\n    system_template: |-\n      SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\n      The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.\n      In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\n      COMMANDS:\n      {command_docs}\n\n      Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n      If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!

Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n      ```\n      ls -a\n      ```\n\n      You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n      If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n2024-07-12 17:57:44,679 INFO DEMONSTRATION: /Users/fuchur/Documents/24/git_sync/SWE-agent/trajectories/demonstrations/human_thought__swe-bench-HumanEvalFix-python__lcb__t-0.00__p-0.95__c-4.00__install-0/humanevalfix-python-0.traj\n2024-07-12 17:57:44,680 INFO Trajectory will be saved to trajectories/fuchur/azure-gpt4__problem__coding_challenge__t-0.00__p-0.95__c-3.00__install-1/26d111.traj\n2024-07-12 17:57:44,747 INFO \ud83e\udd16 MODEL INPUT\nWe're currently attempting to solve the following problem:\nISSUE:\nGiven an unsorted integer array nums.\nReturn the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.\n\nYou must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.\n\n## Example 1:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [1,2,0]\n&gt; Output: 3\n&gt; Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.\n\n## Example 2:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]\n&gt; Output: 2\n&gt; Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.\n\n## Example 3:\n\n&gt; Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]\n&gt; Output: 1\n&gt; Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.\n\n## Constraints:\n\n1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105\n-231 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 231 - 1\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python &lt;script_name&gt;.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Write your solution in main.py. Always test your code thoroughly before submitting, and if any of the tests fail, try to fix the code before continuing.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /__Users__fuchur__Documents__24__git_sync__empty)\nbash-$\n2024-07-12 17:57:48,042 INFO input_tokens=3,705, output_tokens=48, instance_cost=0.04, cost=0.04\n2024-07-12 17:57:48,044 INFO total_tokens_sent=3,705, total_tokens_received=48, total_cost=0.04, total_api_calls=1\n2024-07-12 17:57:48,045 INFO \ud83d\udcad THOUGHT (primary)\nTo start addressing the issue, I need to access the main.py file where I will implement the solution for the given problem.

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the\n            special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\n            Remember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\n            When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n            Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a\n            python script and then run it with the python command.\n\n            NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\n            GENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n            1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n            2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command\n            multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n            3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a\n            search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work,\n            use the linux 'find' command.\n\n            4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file\n            might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n            5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make\n            sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n            6. When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem.\n            Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n            7. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the\n            issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n            STRATEGY:\n\n            1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n              If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n              Then start trying to fix it.\n\n              If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at\n            the end of the file,\n              so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n            2. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit.\n\n            3. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n            4. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n            5. Create additional tests to verify the fix in a style similar to the existing reproduction script. In particular, make sure to test edge cases.\n               If you find any issues, go back to the file you edited and perform further edits.\n\n            (Open file: n/a)\n            (Current directory: /SWE-agent__test-repo)\n            bash-$\n\ud83e\udd20 INFO     ========================= STEP 1 =========================\n\ud83e\udd16 DEBUG    input_tokens=7,862, output_tokens=36, instance_cost=0.04, cost=0.04\n\ud83e\udd16 DEBUG    total_tokens_sent=7,862, total_tokens_received=36, total_cost=0.04, total_api_calls=1\n\ud83e\udd20 INFO     \ud83d\udcad THOUGHT\n            Let's start by finding the `missing_colon.py` file that's mentioned in the issue.

At the top level, there are three important sections:</p> <ul> <li><code>problem_statement</code>: What problem are you trying to solve?</li> <li><code>agent</code>: How do you want to solve the problem? This includes setting up the LM with <code>--agent.model</code>.</li> <li><code>env</code>: What is the environment in which the problem statement should be solved?   This includes setting the repository/folder with the source files with <code>--env.repo</code>, as well as docker images and other dependencies.   This will also control where the code is executed (in a local container or in the cloud).</li> </ul> <p>Watching the output, you can notice several stages:</p> <ol> <li>Setting up the deployment: SWE-agent lets LMs execute actions in sandboxed environments. It can run these environments    in docker containers (default), on modal, AWS fargate, or directly on your computer (not recommended).    When the deployment starts, you will notice a \"starting runtime\" message that takes a few seconds. The runtime is    what is executing the commands within your deployment.</li> <li>Setting up tools: The tools that you specified are copied and installed within the environment.</li> <li>System and instance prompts: The initial instructions are shown to the LM.</li> <li>Main loop: The LM starts to suggest and execute actions.</li> <li>Submission: The LM calls <code>submit</code> and we extract the patch (i.e., the changes to the source code that solve the problem).</li> </ol> <p>The complete details of the run are saved as a \"trajectory\" file (more about them here).

Here's the issue text:\\nISSUE:\\nTimeDelta serialization precision\\nHi there!\\n\\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\\n\\n```python3\\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\n\\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\\\"milliseconds\\\")\\n\\nobj = dict()\\nobj[\\\"td_field\\\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\\n\\nprint(td_field.serialize(\\\"td_field\\\", obj))\\n```\\n\\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\\n\\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\\n\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python &lt;script_name&gt;.py`.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\\n   Then start trying to fix it.\\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\\n   \\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\\\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\\\") command at the end of the file,\\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \\n\\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \\n   \\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \\\"buggy-input.png\\\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \\n\\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n\\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\\n   \\n\\n(Open file: n/a)\\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\\nbash-$\",\n            \"agent\": \"primary\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"message_type\": \"action\",\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": \"Let's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.
