## Running the Web UI

!!! warning "Web UI"
    We're currently working on updating the web UI to be compatible with the latest version of SWE-agent.
    Please use the [using the command line](../usage/cl_tutorial.md) until this is fixed.

Go to the terminal and enter

```bash
./start_web_ui.sh
```

After a while, you should see a popup offering you to forward port `3000`. Click `Open in Browser`.

If you instead only see the offer to forward port `8000`, do not click it (this is the port that's being used by the backend).

Instead, click on the `Ports` tab, and click on the globe next to port `3000`:
