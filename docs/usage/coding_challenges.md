# Using SWE-agent for coding challenges

!!! tip "Command line tutorial"
    We also provide a more general [command line tutorial](cl_tutorial.md), which covers
    many more advanced features of SWE-agent, but focuses on its use for software engineering
    problems.

It is easy to use SWE-agent to do more than just software engineering.
For example, you can tell SWE-agent to work on leetcode or humaneval-style problems.

For this, put the problem you want to solve in a markdown file `problem.md`, for example:

<details>
<summary>Example leetcode challenge</summary>

This is the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/">first missing positive</a> challenge.

```markdown
--8<-- "docs/usage/leetcode_example.md"
```

</details>

Second, we need to specify a repository wherein SWE-agent will work.
Here, we can simply create an empty folder, and add a `main.py` file

```bash
mkdir empty
touch main.py
```

and potentially populate it with the problem stub

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
```

!!! tip
    If some imports (like `List`) are missing in the problem stub (like they oftentimes do
    in leetcode) , SWE-agent will figure out how to add them. However, it might take an
    additional step, so it's best to directly specify them.

Make sure to commit all changes to the repository:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Add problem stub"
```

Now, we can let SWE-agent solve the problem:

```bash
python run.py \
    --data_path problem.md \
    --repo_path /path/to/empty \
    --config_file config/coding_challenge.yaml \
    --model gpt4 \
    --cost_limit 3.0
```

<summary>Output</summary>

```
--8<-- "docs/usage/leetcode_example.md"
```

</details>

SWE-agent will typically conclude with a message like

```

This informs you of the location of the [trajectory](trajectories.md) and of the patch file that contains the solution.

In our case, this looks like this:
