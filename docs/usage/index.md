# Usage

We currently provide two interfaces to SWE-agent: The [command line interface (CLI)](cl_tutorial.md) and our [graphical web interface](web_ui.md). 

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-keyboard:{ .lg .middle } __Command line interface (CLI)__

    --- 

    The default way of running SWE-agent with maximum options.
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Get started](cl_tutorial.md)

-   :material-mouse:{ .lg .middle } __Graphical user interface__

    --- 

    We provide a browser-based graphical user interface particularly optimized for developers wanting to use SWE-agent as a tool.

</div>

While the latter is more beginner-friendly, the CLI currently still has more expert options.
